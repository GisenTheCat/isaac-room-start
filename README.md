# Treasure Room Start
Treasure Room Start is a mod for *[The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2560433301)*, written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) using the [IsaacScript](https://isaacscript.github.io/) framework.

This mod automatically reseeds runs until you start next to a desired room: treasure and planetarium rooms enabled by default.
# Features
* Automatically start runs next to desired room types.
* Preserves your run streak.
* Support for manually holding R to restart runs.
* Safeguards to prevent soft-locking (ie: has no effect in seeded runs, since they can't be reseeded).
