# Treasure Room Start ![Build Status](https://github.com/siramok/treasure-room-start/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)
Treasure Room Start is a mod for *[The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2560433301)*, written in [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) using the [IsaacScript](https://isaacscript.github.io) framework.

This mod automatically reseeds runs until you start next to a desired room: treasure and planetarium rooms enabled by default. Useful as a quality of life tool, but it can also be used to find specific seeds for research purposes.
# Features
* Automatically start runs next to desired room types.
* Force specific curses to be active when starting runs.
* Preserves your run streak.
* Support for manually holding R to restart runs.
* Safeguards to prevent soft-locking, including a configurable reseed limiter.
* Optional support for Eden and Tainted Eden to avoid consuming extra Eden tokens.
